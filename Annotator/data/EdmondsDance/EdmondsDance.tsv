When we first came here. We were cold and we were clear. With no colors on our skin.	3
We were light and paper-thin. And when we first came here. We were cold and we were clear.	3
With no colors on our skin. 'Till you let the spectrum in. Say my name.	3

Kissing eyes and kissing palms. When it's time to pray. We dressed up all in gray.	3
With metal on our tongues. And silver in our lungs. Say my name. And every color illuminates.	3
We are shining. And we'll never be afraid again. Say my name. And every color illuminates.	3
We are shining. And we will never be afraid again. Say my name. And every color illuminates.	3

I turn the music up, I got my records on. I shut the world outside until the lights come on.	3
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone.	3
I feel my heart start beating to my favourite song.	3
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night. Until Monday morning feels another life.	3
I turn the music up. I'm on a roll this time. And heaven is in sight.	3
I turn the music up, I got my records on. From underneath the rubble sing a rebel song.	3
Don't want to see another generation drop. I'd rather be a comma than a full stop.	3
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees. Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes.	3
But my heart is beating and my pulses start. Cathedrals in my heart.	3
As we saw oh this light I swear you, emerge blinking into. To tell me it's alright.	3

I was a boat drifting out into sea.	1
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope that you would see me.	1
I was a stone's throw away from land.	1
But thousands and thousands of miles away from reaching your hand. The waves that crashed upon.	1
The rocks that you were trying to walk along. And in my head I heard them play a song.	1
For you and me. The waves that crashed upon. The rocks that you were trying to step along.	1
And in my head I heard them play a song. For you and me. Let's get lost at sea.	1
Where they will never find us. Got stars at night to guide us. Lost at sea.	1
Where they will never find us. Got stars at night to guide us, yeah.	1
I was a boat drifting out into sea.	1
I had nothing but pieces of thoughts of the hope that you would see me.	1

Where they will never find us. Got stars at night to guide us. Lost at sea.	1
As a kid they told me love was made up. But I used to tell them they were wrong.	1
It's the blue eyed girl that made me wake up. Stayed right behind me in this song.	1
Instead they counted every heartbeat. Thinking about the words to say.	1
Try not to understand our feeling. Would it ever go away. Now those were the days.	1
Before you had to go away. Now I'm dancing by myself. I'm in the rain.	1
Now it's getting rather cold. And I just wanted you to know. That if my dreams will ever be.	1
Will you come dancing next to me. Next to me. Next to me. Next to me.	1
You told me we would be forever. But maybe we were just too young. I wonder if you still remember.	1
When we were dancing in the sun. Now those were the days. Before you had to go away.	1
Now I'm dancing by myself. I'm in the rain. Now it's getting rather cold.	1
And I just wanted you to know. That if my dreams will ever be. Will you come dancing next to me.	1
Next to me. Next to me. Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me.	1
Captured effortlessly. That's the way it was. Happened so naturally. I did not know it was love.	3
The next thing I felt was you. Holding me close. What was I gonna do. I let myself go.	3
And now we're flyin' through the stars. I hope this night will last forever. Oh oh oh oh.	3
Ain't nobody. Loves me better. Makes me happy. Makes me feel this way. Ain't nobody.	3
Loves me better than you. I've been waitin' for you. It's been so long.	3
I knew just what I would do. When I heard your song. You filled my heart with a kiss.	3
You gave me freedom. You knew I could not resist. I needed someone.	3
And now we're flyin' through the stars. I hope this night will last forever. Oh oh oh oh.	3
Ain't nobody. Loves me better. Makes me happy. Makes me feel this way. Ain't nobody.	3
Loves me better than you. At first you put your arms around me. Then you put your charms around me.	3
We stare into each others eyes. And what we see is no surprise. Got a feeling most with treasure.	3
And a love so deep we cannot measure. Ain't nobody. Loves me better. Makes me happy.	3
Makes me feel this way. Ain't nobody. Loves me better than you. Ain't nobody. Loves me better.	3
Paint on a caution wind. 'Neath the bleeding sky. I called your name. There was no one there.	1
And in the cold and snow. I saw your face. And we sang our song for the little thing.	1
Magic calm, but the joy you bring . Running it down the line.	1
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing. Magic calm from a pretty thing.	1
Maybe it might be time. For a better day. For a better day. For a better day.	1
Straight, from the path of love. In the road of life. I tumble forward. But I'm going on.	1
I'ma keep it strong. I saw your face. And we sang our song for the little thing.	1
Magic calm, but the joy you bring. Running it down the line.	1
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing. Magic calm from a pretty thing.	1
Maybe it might be time. For a better day. For a better day. For a better day. For a better day.	1
For a better day. For a better day. And we sang our song for the little thing.	1
Magic calm, but the joy you bring. Running it down the line.	1
Wish you could find that love is a fragile thing. Magic calm from a pretty thing.	1
Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes. My, my, my eagle eyes. Marching down the street in my lightning feet.	3
And the shine's too fine to be real. Fake it so I care for the glisten and the glare.	3
And now it's something I'm starting to feel. Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes. My, my, my eagle eyes.	3
I caught with my eagle eyes. Oh, oh, ah, my eagle eyes. My, my, my eagle eyes. Oh.	3
My, my, my eagle eyes. Left it up to the great wide open. To find out the places I'd be.	3
In my sleep they were growing all the time. And now they've grown too far for me.	3
I didn't know how to wait out the ages. So I wrecked my only way through.	3
Blind bravery forgets the wars it wages. But I'll fight just to see if it's true.	3

I'd like to teach the world to sing. Hope when you take that jump. You don't fear the fall.	3
Hope when the water rises. You built a wall. Hope when the crowd screams out.	3
They're screaming your name. Hope if everybody runs. You choose to stay.	3
Hope that you fall in love. And it hurts so bad (Yeah). The only way you can know.	3
You gave it all you had. And I hope that you don't suffer. But take the pain.	3
Hope when the moment comes,. You'll say. I, I did it all. I, I did it all.	3
I owned every second that this world could give. I saw so many places, the things that I did.	3
Yeah with every broken bone. I swear I lived. I'd like to teach the world to sing.	3
In perfect harmony. Hope that you spend your days. But they all add up.	3
And when that sun goes down. Hope you raise your cup. I wish that I could witness.	3
All your joy and all your pain. But until my moment comes. I'll say. I, I did it all.	3
I, I did it all. I owned every second that this world could give.	3

This method acting might pay our bills. But soon enough there'll be a different role to fill.	1
I love this feeling. But I hate this part. I wanted this to work so much.	1
I drew up our plans on a chart. Cars are flipping, I'm in hot pursuit.	1
My character's strong but my head is loose. She hits like ecstasy.	1

And the blades rotate there's just no landing pad.	1
And better have said it but darling you're the best.	1
I'm just tired of falling up the Penrose steps. I hate this feeling. But I love this part.	1
She really wants to make it work. And I clearly want to let it start. We'll build a water slide.	1
As soon as I get home. Oh and she hits like ecstasy. Comes up and bangs the sense out of me.	1
It's wrong but surely worse to leave. She hits like ecstasy. So free up the cheaper seats.	1

One side of me says stop so you don't blow. The other side says what would I stop for.	1
Opposite as the day and night. As different as the sun and moon is.	1

Drivin' a windy road. Bipolar as I can go. I tried to keep it straight. But ended up into a hole.	1
All I ever wanted to be was me. Now I know not who I am. One day I'm Lex Luthor.	1
The next I think I'm Superman. I was walkin' on the water. Now I'm sinkin' in the sand.	1

Sunny day dreams and we up now. Vodka lemonade I serve it up it goes down.	3
75 degrees and a dope sound. All you need to live fine to live fine.	3
A little sunshine because she need it. A dose of rain far in the evening.	3
The waves crash down and we feel them. Say here's to the night we steal them.	3
And I be running cause I figured out. The more I slow down the less I get out.	3
And if we fall let's be strong now. Moving along we don't mind we don't mind. . All the good.	3
Comes in waves. I bide my time by the ocean. And at night. I'm awake.	3
To feel the wake of your motion. And I. Want something that's feeling alright.	3
Loose cannon but still it won't fight. No need to leave spend our whole lives.	3
Another day in paradise. . I'll be gone until November.	3
And Going through the letters that I send her. And thinking about the moment that I met her.	3
Well I'll be back in due time in due time. Touchdown throw off my own two shoes.	3
Still the same city I'll be used to. And all the reckless things that we do.	3
Keep us young they're good signs they're good signs. Take a little more if you need it.	3
Voices of the night were misleaded. The tide pulls me in but it takes slow.	3
Here's to the nights that we let go. And I'm hoping that they figure out.	3
It's all about the scenery along the route. No fears and no problems.	3
These moments are so kind they so kind. . All the good. Comes in waves.	3

Hidden behind the smiles we both wear. As the sun creeps through the curtains.	3
On the walls we become two silhouettes. As we close our eyes.	3
Let go of the lies that fill our heads. Let's light it up, live life in the moment.	3
Why would we worry about where we might end up?.	3
They can't see us, they can't judge us, it's just us.	3

I am sitting. In the morning. At the diner. On the corner. I am waiting. At the counter.	0,1
For the man. To pour the coffee. And he fills it. Only halfway. And before. I even argue.	0,1
"He is looking. Out the window. At somebody. Coming in. ""It is always. Nice to see you""."	0,1
Says the man. Behind the counter. To the woman. Who has come in. She is shaking. Her umbrella.	0,1
And I look. The other way. As they are kissing. Their hellos. And I'm pretending. Not to see them.	0,1
And instead. I pour the milk. I open. Up the paper. There's a story. Of an actor. Who had died.	0,1
While he was drinking. It was no one. I had heard of. And I'm turning. To the horoscope.	0,1
And looking. For the funnies. When I'm feeling. Someone watching me. And so. I raise my head.	0,1
There's a woman. On the outside. Looking inside. Does she see me?. No, she does not. Really see me.	0,1
'Cause she sees. Her own reflection. And I'm trying. Not to notice. That she's hitching.	0,1
Up her skirt. And while she's. Straightening her stockings. Her hair. Has gotten wet.	0,1
Oh, this rain. It will continue. Through the morning. As I'm listening. To the bells.	0,1
Of the cathedral. I am thinking. Of your voice. And of the midnight picnic. Once upon a time.	0,1
